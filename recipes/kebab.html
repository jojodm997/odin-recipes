        <h2>Turkey Kofta Kebabs</h2>
        <p>These turkey kofta kebabs were introduced to me about 20 years ago by my Persian neighbor. I never actually got his recipe, but I'm pretty good at replicating flavors, and these came pretty close. He made them with beef but using turkey instead makes these a lot lighter.</p>
